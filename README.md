# Grave in Commit Message

Example of grave accent symbol (`` ` ``) in monospace in commit message -> look at this repo commit message.

I want to have exactly this in commit message:  
> swap `` ` `` and `'`

But inputing
> ``` swap `` ` `` and `'` ```

gives
> swap \`` `\``  and  `'`

instead of desired.
